- Epochs: Up to 50 (with early stopping tracking validation loss)


Model Evaluation Storage Mechanism
----------------------------------
Prediction generation logic uses `src/utils/track_predictions.py`.
1. Data Storage: Predictions are stored locally in a comma-separated values (CSV) log file located at `data/prediction_history.csv`.
2. Prediction Record: For each valid ML prediction day, a pipeline process records the LSTM, TFT, and Ensemble predictions under a new row representing that date.
3. Actual Price Backfilling: When the tracking logic runs on subsequent days, it loads authoritative historical stock prices from `data/stock_data.csv`. The script identifies the actual Close market price that occurred for previous predicted dates and backfills the empty `Actual_Close_Price` column in `prediction_history.csv`.
4. Result: This table generates empirical data aligning "what we predicted" strictly against "what actually happened" to easily calculate true operational MAPE, MSE, or R².
